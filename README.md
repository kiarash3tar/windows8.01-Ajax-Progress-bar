Windows 8.01 Ajax Progress bar using CSS3

I was searching this progress bar for a while in the net and I couldn't find a hight quality version with actuall spedd
<br>
So as usual I decided to make it by myself.

`<h6>Ans here we go... That's very simple`
just copy the `CSS` part in your `.css` file or inside `Head` tag, and style the `progressbarWrapper` `div tag` where you want in your page...

Have Fun...
